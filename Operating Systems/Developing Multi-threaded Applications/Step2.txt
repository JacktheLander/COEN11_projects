Delete the second for loop in threadHello.c program so that the main function simply creates
NTHREADS threads and then prints “Main thread done” and immediately returns. What are the possible
outputs of the program now? Explain. Count the number of lines of output if needed.

Because of the different go functions the ids are still sometimes wrong but 20 threads are always created. There are 2 possible outputs, the correct id is printed or the incorrect id. It sometimes runs the function with the incorrect id after the return to main.
