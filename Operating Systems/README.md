# Operating Systems
In Operating Systems by Professor Shaghaghi I learned about process management, memory management, and performance evaluation in a linux environment.
We also learned to modify minix files to build our own version of the OS within a virtual machine, and were introduced to multithreaded applications in Java as well.
